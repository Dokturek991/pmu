# FAQ 

Q: **Hey, what is this? I can’t use vanilla tools!**
A: That’s intentional. We wanted to try something different and encourage players to step outside their comfort zones 
   and the usual repetitive Minecraft start. Vanilla tools and armor are reserved for MineColonies colonists only. :)

Q: **Why can’t I use autocrafting with Refined Storage?**
A: Our main focus is the official server, where we aim to create an immersive experience by slowly developing civilization 
   from medieval times onward. If you’re playing singleplayer or hosting your own server, you can find a guide on GitHub 
   explaining how to enable Refined Storage as a full package.

Q: **I found a bug. Do I need a Discord account to report it?**
A: No. We have a dedicated GitHub page for the modpack. Just click on the “Issues” tab on the project page, and it will 
   take you directly to the GitHub issues tracker.

Q: **How can I update my server using the server files? Do we need to start over?**
A: No, you don’t need to start over. Simply move your world and config folders into the new version, and you’re good to go.

Q: **My game has terrible FPS. What can I do?**
A: The best step is to report it to us so we can try to find a solution together. Otherwise, you can try increasing your 
   RAM allocation. We recommend 6,000–8,000 MB at most.

Q: **I want to play on the official server with my friends. How can we join?**
A: Join our Discord server and apply for a whitelist. This helps us keep the server secure and free of griefers.

Q: **Can I play on the official server with a cracked client?**
A: No. Cracked clients often lead to griefing, trolling, or hacking, since users can just pick a new username and try again. 
   We don’t allow them, even if you pinky swear. :)

Q: **I have a question about gameplay or technical stuff. What should I do?**
A: You can either join our Discord server or ask in the Discussions tab on GitHub. :)
